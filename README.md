This repository provides all data and source code for the FPGA based electro-optic modulator (EOM) driver. 

Structure: 
- Python folder contains mathematical model and numerical simulations of the timebin patterns, EOM switching time estimation, 
  timebins probabilities analysis and FPGA board communication script.
  
- VHDL folder contains all the source codes for EOM FPGA driver with testbench of the top entity.
